Taken from IT206 - Project Specification

"The purpose of this project is to demonstrate an acceptable level of expertise with the fundamental
procedural and object-oriented concepts and GUI implementation techniques introduced and refined in
class lectures and labs during the course of the semester.

This project contains:

"Driver: A driver file should be used to initialize the game and display the game GUI. 

The filename should be in the following format:

Game operation: The game should allow a player to play one of three games. When game
starts, a game board should be presented to player. If player wins game, they should be notified
and the game reset to another game board. There should be exactly three 5 x 5 game boards
hard-coded into class objects in the application.

Game board class: A class should be designed to hold each game board. This class should
hold all data (attributes) associated with the game board (including correct solution) and should
provide appropriate methods that facilitate game operation (e.g., is current solution valid,
accessors to facilitate game board GUI construction, etc.). A complex data structure should be
utilized to store/access the game board objects in the appropriate file.

Game controls: The game should have exactly three controls: WIN? (checks the game board
for a winning combination of numbers), RESET (reloads the current game) and QUIT
(terminates the game). The player should select a number for each square using the mouse. The
game should check for a winning number combination after each player interaction. If the
player wins, a new game board should be loaded.

GUI: A GUI class should be implemented that contains all game GUI components and event
model implementation."
